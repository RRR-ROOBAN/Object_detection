3.We want to run that file it detect the object from the video input
4.To use this deep learning model we make gui so we set the files 1.admin.py 2.base.html, 3.settings.py, 4.urls.py 5.login.html 6.base.html,7.home.html into that created environment
5.From that those files we make a login page using login html template
